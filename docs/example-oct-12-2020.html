But how does dexamethasone work? And why did its use fuel speculation about both the severity of Trump&#x2019;s disease and its effect on his mood after his release from the hospital?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the most serious cases of Covid-19 are the result of an overreaction of a patient&#x2019;s own immune system to the virus that causes the disease. This response, called a &#x201C;cytokine storm,&#x201D; can cause immune cells to attack not only the virus, but healthy tissues as well. Cytokine storms can cause permanent damage to the lungs, and in some cases, prove deadly.&#xA0;</span></p><p><a href="">Read the rest&hellip;</a></p>
